<h1>Paradox</h1>
<p class = "first">
Definition : A statement or proposition that, despite sound (or apparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems senseless, logically unacceptable, or self-contradictory.
</p>
<h2>Categorizations<h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Paradox of verification</li>
		<li>Paradox having a false basis</li>
		<li>Paradox of self-contradiction</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	<br>
	Paradox of verification or Verifical Paradoxes are paradoxes the result of which is absurd, but presented in a way that makes it appear true. It is a situation seemingly impossible or contradictory but nevertheless true.
	<br/>
	For example: A twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays, if he had been born on a leap day.
	<br/>
	Paradox on False basis or Falisidical paradoxes are based on the results that do not just seem untrue but really are false. The proof derived by seemingly correct reasoning that leads to an illogical and false conclusion. 
	<br/>
	For example: Various mathematical fallacies like - All numbers equal all other numbers(Eg: 1=2)
	<br/>
	Paradox of Self-Contradictions are in neither class may be an antinomy, which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.
	<br/>
	For example: the adjective "red" is equated with the set of all red objects. In this way, the adjective "pronounceable" is equated with the set of all pronounceable things, one of which is the word "pronounceable" itself. Thus, an autological word is understood as a set, one of whose elements is the set itself. The question of whether the word "heterological" is heterological becomes the question of whether the set of all sets not containing themselves contains itself as an element.

<h2>Gabriel's Horn<h2>

	<p>
	A Gabriel Horn  is obtained by rotating the curve y = 1/x, from x = 1 to ∞ around the x-axis.  The main thing is that it is essentially a trumpet/horn kind of thing that keeps going on and on for ever and ever, getting thinner and thinner, but never closing off.
	<br/>
	This was first brought up by Evangelista Torricelli ( 1608 - 1647 ) who was a student of Galileo.  As a young man he studied in Galileo's home at Arcetri near Florence.  Upon Galileo's death, Torricelli succeeded his teacher as mathematician and philosopher for their good friend and patron, the Grand Duke of Tuscany.
	Torricelli's own words fully describe his amazement at discovering an infinitely long solid with a surface that calculates to have an infinite area, but a finite volume.  "It may seem incredible that although this solid has an infinite length, nevertheless none of the cylindrical surfaces we considered has an infinite length but all of them are finite."  This "incredible" paradox prompted Torricelli to try several alternate proofs.But Torricelli never lived to prove the paradox and nor was he destined to see the emergence of calculus after his time. 
	<br/>
	The paradox states - The volume of Gabriel’s horn is finite (π units cubed) but the surface area is infinite. It doesn't seem so confusing until you actually start thinking about it's practicalities. If we were to fill the gabriel's horn, we would need π  cubed units of paint where are to actually paint the horn you would require infinite amounts of paint.

<h2>The Omnipotence Paradox<h2>
	<img src="omnipotent.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:256px;height:256px;float: right">
	
	<p> Can God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it?
	<br/>
	The argument is medieval, dating at least to the 12th century, addressed by Averroës (1126–1198) and later by Thomas Aquinas.Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to "deny himself".
	<br/>
	Either God can create such a stone or he can’t.If he can’t, the argument goes, then there is something that he cannot do, namely create the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. If he can, it continues, then there is also something that he cannot do, namely lift the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent.Either way, then, God is not omnipotent. A being that is not omnipotent, though, is not God. God, therefore, does not exist.
	<br/>
	Several answers have been proposed to solve this paradox. For instance, many eminent philosphers suggested that Omnipotence, does not mean that God can do anything at all but, rather, that he can do anything that's possible according to his nature. The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature.

<h2>TheParadox of Heap<h2>
	<img src="grain.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:512px;height:256px;float: left">
	
	<p> Sorites paradoxes are a class of paradoxical arguments also known as little-by-little arguments. The name "sorites" derives from the Greek word soros, meaning "pile" or "heap." Sorites paradoxes are exemplified by the problem that a single grain of wheat does not comprise a heap, nor do two grains of wheat, three grains of wheat, etc. However, at some point, the collection of grains becomes large enough to be called a heap, but there is apparently no definite point where this occurs.
	<br/>
	This concept also works with someone who is rich. Clearly if we take a dollar away from someone who is a millionaire, it will make little difference. The rich person is still rich. What if we keep doing it? At what point do they become poor? $100,000? $10,000? $5000?This paradox has been the subject of intense debate among philosophers for thousands of years.
